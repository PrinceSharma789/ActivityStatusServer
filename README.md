Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your machine.

Installing Dependencies
Before starting the server, you need to download the necessary packages. Run the following command in your project directory:
"npm install"
This will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file.

Starting the Server
After the packages have been installed, you can start the server by running the following command:
"node server.js"
This will start the server and it should be accessible at the specified port (by default, typically localhost:3000 unless otherwise configured).

Notes
Ensure your environment variables are properly configured, if needed.
You may need to adjust the port or other configurations in the server.js file depending on your setup.
